# MintNFT

This project is part of the **MintNFT course**, focused on learning how to **mint NFTs on Ethereum** using Solidity and Hardhat.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Understand the core concepts of ERC-721 and how NFT minting works on Ethereum. By the end of this project, youâ€™ll have hands-on experience deploying and interacting with your own NFT smart contract.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mintnft.git
   cd mintnft
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Compile the contracts:
   ```bash
   npm hardhat compile
   ```
6. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   npm hardhat test
   ```

## ðŸ§ª What's Inside
A basic NFT smart contract written in Solidity (ERC-721)
Scripts for deployment and interaction
Unit tests for minting functionality
Local development using Hardhat

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
1. Node.js (v16+)
2. npm
3. Hardhat CLI
